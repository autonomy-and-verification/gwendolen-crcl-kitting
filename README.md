# gwendolen-crcl-kitting
Gwendolen code for a simulation of a kitting problem, using an interface with CRCL.

<!-- Requires [gwendolen-rosbridge](https://github.com/autonomy-and-verification-uol/gwendolen-rosbridge) to be installed and working. -->

To run the kitting simulation:
1. Install [MCAPL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcapl/) using the Eclipse method, and make sure that you can run Gwendolen code (hello world at `src/examples/gwendolen/tutorials/tutorial1`)
2. Copy the `src` folder to MCAPL root
3. In Eclipse, go to `src/examples/gwendolen/crcl/kitting`, right-click `robot.ail`, select run as > run configurations, type `run-AIL` in the search box (should be there if MCAPL was installed correctly), and click on run
