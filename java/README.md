# BACKGROUND

This folder contains CRCL related source code for building jar library files. Note to compile the code
it is assumed Netbeans has been installed.

Each folder can be used as a maven Netbeans project. 

The crcl4java-base folder contains a batch file which 
will invoke maven to clean and build the crcl4java-base jar file in the target subfolder.
